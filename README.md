- This example provided a simple scenario: a user creates a ticket, the ticket is assigned, communication takes place between agents, and the issue is ultimately resolved.

- In practice, additional scenarios often occur during the ticket’s lifecycle. A ticket may need to be reassigned to another department, escalated due to severity, or transferred to a     more qualified agent or team depending on the business impact.

- I hope this tutorial has given you a clearer overview of a ticket’s lifecycle. In a typical day, help desk agents may handle anywhere from 10 to 100 tickets, depending on the size of    the company.
